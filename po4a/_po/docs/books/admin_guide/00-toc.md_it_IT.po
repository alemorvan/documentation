"The Administrator's Guide is a collection of educational documents focused "
"on System Administrators. They can be used by future System Administrators "
"trying to get up to speed, by current System Administrators who would like a "
"refresher, or by any Linux user who'd like to learn more about the Linux "
"environment, commands, processes, and more. Like all documents of this type, "
"it will evolve and update over time."

"The VI Text Editor deserves its own chapter. While Linux comes with many "
"editors, VI is one of the most powerful. Other commands sometimes use "
"identical syntax to VI (`sed` comes to mind). So, knowing something about "
"VI, or at least demystifying its essential functions (how to open a file, "
"save, quit or quit without saving), is very important. The user will become "
"more comfortable with the other functions of VI as they use the editor. An "
"alternative would be to use nano which comes installed by default in Rocky "
"Linux. While not as versatile, it is simple to use, straightforward, and "
"gets the job done."

"Backup and Restoration is essential info for the System Administrator. Linux "
