"`vale.sh` is one of the foremost open source projects for technical writers "
"looking to improve their voice and style consistency. It can be used with a "
"number of editors on nearly every major OS platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows). "
"You can find out more about the project by heading up to [the vale.sh "
"website](https://vale.sh/). This guide is going to walk you through adding "
"`vale` to NvChad. Since it is included in the Mason packages for install, "
"the process is not too difficult, although it does involve some minor "
"editing and configuration to get things going. To be clear, NvChad is really "
"the configuration manager for the editor Neovim, so from this point forward, "
"the reference will be `nvim`."
