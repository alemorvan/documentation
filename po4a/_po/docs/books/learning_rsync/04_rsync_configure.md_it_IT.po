"user and group used to transfer files when running the rsync daemon as root. "
"The default is nobody | | use chroot = yes | Whether the root directory "
"needs to be locked before transmission, yes yes, no no. In order to increase "
"security, rsync defaults to yes. | | max connections = 4 | The maximum "
"number of connections allowed, the default value is 0, which means that "

"exclude = lost+found/ |Exclude directories that do not need to be "
"transferred| | transfer logging = yes | Whether to enable ftp-like log "
"format to record rsync uploads and downloads | | timeout = 900 | Specify the "
"timeout period. If no data is transmitted within the specified time, rsync "
