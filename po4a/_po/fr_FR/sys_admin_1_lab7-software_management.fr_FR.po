"#### To use `dnf` for uninstalling packages\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"1.  To use `dnf` to un-install the `wget` package type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ sudo dnf -y remove wget\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"2. Use `dnf` to ensure the package has indeed been removed from the system. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ sudo dnf -y remove wget\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"3. Try using/running `wget`. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ wget\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"#### To use `dnf` for package update\n"
"\n"
"DNF can be used to check for and install the latest version of individual packages that are available in repositories. It can also be used to install specific versions of packages. \n"
"\n"
"1. Use the list option with `dnf` to view all available versions of the `wget` program that are available for your system. Type\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf list wget\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"2. If you only want to see if there are updated versions available for a package, use the check-update option with `dnf`. For example, for the `wget` package type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf check-update wget\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"4. Now list all the available versions for the kernel package for your system. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ sudo dnf list kernel\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"5. Now check if there are any updated packages available for the installed kernel package. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf  check-update kernel\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"6. Updates to packages might be due to bug fixes, new features or security patches. To view if there are any security related updates for the kernel package, type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf  --security check-update kernel\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"#### To use `dnf` for system updates\n"
"\n"
"DNF can be used to check for and install the latest versions all packages installed on a system. Periodically checking for installing updates is an important aspect of system administration. \n"
"\n"
"1. To check if there are any updates for the packages you currently have installed on your system, type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf check-update\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"2. To check if there are any security related updates for all packages installed on your system, type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf --security check-update\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"3. To update the entire packages installed on your system to the most up-to-date versions available for your distribution run:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ dnf -y check-update\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"## Exercise 6\n"
"\n"
"### Building Software from Source\n"
"\n"
"All software/applications/packages originate from plain human-readable text files. The files are collectively known as source code. The RPM packages that are installed on Linux distributions are born from source code. \n"
"\n"
"In this exercise you are going to download, compile and install a sample program from its original source files. For convenience, source files are usually distributed as a single compressed file called a tar-ball (pronounced tar-dot-gee-zee).\n"
"\n"
"The following exercises will be based on the venerable Hello project source code. `hello` is a simple command-line application written in C++, that does nothing more than print \"hello\" to the terminal. You can learn more about [the project here](http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/hello.html)\n"
"\n"
"#### To download the source file\n"
"\n"
"1.  Use `curl` to download the latest source code for the `hello` application. Let us download and save the file in the Downloads folder. \n"
"\n"
"https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.12.tar.gz\n"
"\n"
"#### To un-tar the file\n"
"\n"
"1. Change to the directory on your local machine where you downloaded the hello source code.\n"
"\n"
"2. Unpack (un-tar) the tarball using the `tar` program. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ tar -xvzf hello-2.12.tar.gz\n"
"    hello-2.12/\n"
"    hello-2.12/NEWS\n"
"    hello-2.12/AUTHORS\n"
"    hello-2.12/hello.1\n"
"    hello-2.12/THANKS\n"
"    ...<TRUNCATED>...\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"4. Use the `ls` command to view the contents of your pwd.\n"
"\n"
"    A new directory named  hello-2.12 should have been created for you during the un-taring.\n"
"\n"
"5. Change to that directory and list its contents. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ cd hello-2.12 ; ls\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"6. It is always good practice to review any special installation instructions that might be come with the source code. Those files usually have names like: INSTALL, README and so on.\n"
"\n"
"    Use a pager to open up the INSTALL file and read it. Type:\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ less INSTALL\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"    Exit the pager when you are done reviewing the file.\n"
"\n"
"#### To configure the package\n"
"\n"
"Most applications have features that can be enabled or disabled by the user. This is one of the benefits of having access to the source code and being able to install from same. You have control over configurable features that the application has; this is in contrast to accepting everything a package manager installs from pre-compiled binaries.\n"
"\n"
"The script that usually lets you configure the software is usually aptly named âconfigureâ\n"
"\n"
"1.  Use the `ls` command again to ensure that you indeed have a file named *configure* in your pwd.  \n"
"\n"
"2.  To see all the options, you can enable or disable in the `hello` program type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ ./configure --help\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"    !!! note \"QUESTION:\"\n"
"\n"
"        From the output of the command what does the â--prefixâ option do?\n"
"\n"
"3. If you are happy with the default options that the configure script offers. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ ./configure\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"    !!! note\n"
"\n"
"        Hopefully the configure stage went smoothly and you can go on to the compilation stage.\n"
"\n"
"    If you got some errors during the configure stage, you should carefully look through the tail-end of the output to see the source of the error. The errors are *sometimes* self-explanatory and easy to fix. For example, you might see an error like:\n"
"\n"
"    configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\n"
"\n"
"    The above error simply means that you donât have a C Compiler (e.g., gcc) installed on the system or the compiler is installed somewhere that is not in your PATH variable.\n"
"\n"
"#### To compile the package\n"
"\n"
"You will build the hello application in the following steps. This is where some of the programs that come with the Development Tools group that you installed earlier using DNF come in handy. \n"
"\n"
"1.  Use the make command to compile the package after running the âconfigureâ script. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ make\n"
"    ...<OUTPUT TRUNCATED>...\n"
"    gcc  -g -O2   -o hello src/hello.o  ./lib/libhello.a\n"
"    make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/rocky/hello-2.12'\n"
"    make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/rocky/hello-2.12'\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"    If all goes well - this important `make` step is the step that will help generate the final `hello` application binary.\n"
"\n"
"2. List the files in your current working directory again. You should see some newly created files in there including the `hello` program.\n"
"\n"
"#### To install the application\n"
"\n"
"Amongst other housekeeping tasks, the final installation step also involves copying any application binaries and libraries over to the proper folders. \n"
"\n"
"1. To install the hello application run the make install command. Type:\n"
"\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ sudo make install\n"
"    ```\n"
"    This will install package into the location specified by the default prefix (--prefix) argument that may have been used with the âconfigureâ script earlier. If no --prefix was set, a default prefix of `/usr/local/` will be used. \n"
"\n"
"#### To run the hello program\n"
"\n"
"1. Use the `whereis` command to see where the `hello` program is on your system. Type:\n"
"    ```\n"
"    $ whereis hello\n"
"    ```\n"
"\n"
"2. Try running the `hello` application to see what it does. Type:\n"
"    ```\n"
"   $ hello\n"
