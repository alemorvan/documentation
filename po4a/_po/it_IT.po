msgid "The VI Text Editor deserves its own chapter. While Linux comes with many editors, VI is one of the most powerful. Other commands sometimes use identical syntax to VI (`sed` comes to mind). So, knowing something about VI, or at least demystifying its essential functions (how to open a file, save, quit or quit without saving), is very important. The user will become more comfortable with the other functions of VI as they use the editor. An alternative would be to use nano which comes installed by default in Rocky Linux. While not as versatile, it is simple to use, straightforward, and gets the job done.\n"
